# Constants in one very long block

func_00109488 (FillObjectPropertyTable) is 9,348 instructions of stores of
constants with no call and no branch: one basic block. How GCC 2.95 gives
such a block its registers (2026-11-08, `-dl -dg` dumps, global.c,
reload.c and reload1.c read):

- **CSE starts over every 1,001 insns** (cse_basic_block), in both passes,
  so a constant gets a new pseudo in each window (nonmatching/func_00109488.cpp
  has the landmarks).
- **sched1 runs constants ahead of their stores.** A constant's set depends
  on nothing, so the list scheduler issues it in any free slot, and the lead
  grows along the block: the 4 of entries 142-237 is set at entry 79, the 18
  of entries 656-750 at entry 235. Retail's births are the same (its `li t8,4`
  is at entry 79), so this is not where the two differ.
- **local-alloc places the pseudos by priority** (`floor_log2(refs) * refs /
  lifetime`), each in the lowest register free over its whole life; a pseudo
  it cannot place goes to global-alloc. In one long block most do: 1,865 of
  2,068 here.
- **global-alloc evicts a whole register.** When an allocno finds no free
  register, find_reg scans the registers from the end of the allocation
  order and takes the first whose local pseudos have fewer refs per insn of
  life (summed over the function) than the allocno, unassigning every
  pseudo in it. The other allocnos still record conflicts with the evicted
  pseudos, so nothing else ever gets that register: here s1, s3, s5 and s6
  each hold one pseudo, and retail's s3 holds only 4 (entries 0-89).
- **reload takes the cheapest register per insn.** order_regs_for_reload
  prefers, for each insn, the registers with no live pseudo in allocation
  order, then the fewest refs of live pseudos. Ours ends with s1, s3 and s6
  as the reload registers (about 270 sets each), retail with t9 and s1, then
  s4, s8, t8 and s2.
- **A constant reloaded is looked for in the last register set to it.**
  find_equiv_reg (reload.c) walks back to the nearest insn that sets any
  hard register to the constant and returns nothing if that register has
  changed since; it does not look further back. So a constant held in a
  register that nothing else takes is reused to the end of the block (ours
  stores every 4 from s5), and once a later pseudo of it is given a register
  that is then reused, every reload of it is rebuilt (retail's 24 `li 4`
  after entry 237). Merging Set10's three equal arguments (one argument
  stored to fC, f14 and f18) gives the window-2 pseudo of 4 t8 in local-alloc,
  as retail has it, and retail's exact count of `li 4`; in this file's form it
  loses t8 to the 18 born at entry 235, whose life overlaps its last 35
  insns, and t9 to the 4242 born at entry 169.
- **A pseudo local-alloc could place is not always placed, and placed is not
  kept.** Its priorities and lifetimes are in its own numbering, and with
  INSN_SCHEDULING it retries a qty with a lifetime one insn longer at each
  end. A register that a model built from the `.lreg` lengths shows as free
  can therefore still be refused. After local-alloc, global-alloc's
  eviction and reload's spills can take the register back. Only the final
  code says whether a constant kept its register.
- **The constants are coupled.** In searches on func_00109488
  (build/swarm/big-109488/dsearch.py), Set10 merges on a few calls kept 8
  of the 10 window landmarks once Set8m calls were unmerged to make up the
  count. Each Set10 merge takes two insns from the `.jump` count and each
  unmerge adds one, and the landmarks before entry 553 allow a net -1 to +7.
  With the window-2 4 placed, `li 4` went from 1 to 24-40 (retail has 24).
  But func_00155778 then went from +7 to +16, 0x880 to +8 and 6 to +7. The
  distance in per-value build counts (the sum over values of
  |ours - retail| builds) was 107 at best, against 89-90 for the near miss
  that keeps 4 in s5. Freeing one constant's register re-permutes the rest.

What decides the bytes is therefore which handful of long-lived constants
local-alloc places, which follows the number and lives of the pseudos at
each point, that is the source's argument and statement shapes, and through
the CSE windows the instruction counts before each window edge.
func_00109488 has no call, so no callee's return type is involved.
