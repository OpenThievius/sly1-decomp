# The toolchain

The compiler, assembler and linker are proprietary. They are never committed,
and nothing in the repository is copied from them: you supply them, and the
tools find them outside the tree.

## What built the game

**SN Systems' GCC 2.95.3 for the PlayStation 2, compiling C++**, with
`-O2 -G0 -fno-exceptions`, assembled by the EE GNU assembler of the same era.
Measured on 2026-10-28 against seven retail functions of `SCUS_971.98` (a push
onto a list, an add-if-absent loop, a pop, two calls passing a data address, a
float update, and a function with saved registers and a local object): every
one is EXACT with this compiler, on US and on PAL.

| Compiler (folder under `lib/gcc-lib/ee/`) | Banner | The seven functions |
|---|---|---|
| `2.95.3` (sce_ps2_sdk_24) | GCC 2.95.3 SN BUILD 1.14 | 7 EXACT: **the one config/cflags.tsv names** |
| `2.96-ee-001003-1` (sce_ps2_sdk_24) | GCC 2.95.3 SN BUILD v1.07 | 7 EXACT |
| `2.95.2` (sce_ps2_sdk_24) | GCC 2.95.2 SN BUILD v2.74 | 7 EXACT |
| `2.9-ee-991111` (sce_ps2_sdk_24) | GNU 2.9-ee-991111b/r4 (Sony's) | 2 EXACT: it makes tail calls (`j` in place of `jal`) and saves registers in 8 bytes, where retail saves 16 (`sq`) |

The three SN builds agree on everything measured so far; SN BUILD 1.14 is the
working choice because it is the one other 2002 games of the period were built
with. A function that tells the SN builds apart is worth recording here.

What else was measured:

- **The assembler matters.** cc1plus leaves macros and hazards to the
  assembler. Compiled C goes through `ee/bin/as.exe`, the assembler the
  compiler driver runs, with the options the driver gives it (`-G0 -O2`):
  - `move` becomes `daddu`, as in retail; a modern GNU as writes `or`;
  - no `nop` after `mtc1` before the register is used (`li.s`, `cvt.s.w`), as
    in retail. `bin/ee-as.exe`, the same release (`2.9-ee-991111b`) in
    another build, puts one there: measured on `func_00158108` and
    `func_001A7290`, EXACT with `ee/bin/as.exe` only.

  Then GNU objcopy rewrites the object's symbol table in the order modern ld
  wants, without touching code.
- **`-fno-exceptions`.** Without it every file gets C++ exception frame records
  in `.data`; retail has only four such records, all in library code.
- **`-ffunction-sections`** is added to every file so that the build can put
  each function at its retail address (tools/c_layout.py). It changes no code.
- **The preprocessor** is the toolchain's `cpp.exe`, given the macros the
  compiler driver defines (tools/compile.py).

## Getting the compiler

Its Windows build is in the public mirror of Sony's SDK 2.4 tools. Clone it
outside the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/AngheloAlf/sce_ps2_sdk_24 ~/toolchains/sn-prodg-24
ln -s ~/toolchains/sn-prodg-24/local/sce/ee/gcc toolchain     # or export SLY1_TOOLCHAIN=...
```

OpenThievius's `tools/openthievius.py setup` makes the `toolchain` link for you.
If you have an OpenRAC checkout, its `toolchains/sn-prodg-24` is the same mirror.

The Windows tools run on macOS and Linux through
[wibo](https://github.com/decompals/wibo) (or Wine): a `wibo` link in the
repository root, `SLY1_RUNNER`, or `wibo` on `PATH`. Both links are gitignored,
and `tests/check_repository.py` rejects them if they are ever staged.

```sh
python3 tools/toolchain.py      # finds the tools and compiles a test unit
```

The disassembly is assembled and linked by GNU binutils for mips
(`mips-linux-gnu-as`, `-ld`, `-objcopy`, `-objdump`; `brew install
mips-linux-gnu-binutils`, or your distribution's `binutils-mips-linux-gnu`),
with `-march=r5900 -mabi=eabi`. splat writes n32 register names for it.

## Still to qualify

1. **SN build.** A function that compiles differently under the three SN
   builds would settle which one retail used.
2. **Per-file flags.** `-O2 -G0 -fno-exceptions` is every file's default so
   far (config/cflags.tsv); a file that needs other options gets its own row,
   never a function.
3. **The libraries.** Sony's libraries and the compiler's runtime were linked
   from prebuilt archives and need other compilers or options. Their code is
   decompiled from retail like the rest: never from SDK source, headers or
   samples. Measured on 2026-10-29: the double-precision float support at
   0x1FB618–0x1FD6E0 makes tail calls and saves registers in 8 bytes, and
   five of its functions (`func_001FBDF8`, `func_001FCD20`, `func_001FCD78`,
   `func_001FD308`, `func_001FD548`) are EXACT with Sony's `2.9-ee-991111`,
   none with the SN builds.

   **The whole library is Sony's 2.9-ee-991111** (measured on 2026-11-01).
   Every one of the 340 library functions that saves a register saves it
   with `sd`, none with `sq`; 52 of the 619 library functions end in a tail
   jump to a function, against 2 of the 4,151 in game code; and 49 of the 51
   library functions matched with 2.95.3 are EXACT with 2.9-ee-991111 as
   well (the other two sit among `sd`-saving functions and were rewritten).
   config/cflags.tsv names 2.9-ee-991111 in the third column of every
   `src/lib` file's row, and tools/compile.py runs that release's
   `cc1plus.exe`. This is how OpenRAC builds its SDK objects (rac1-decomp,
   `docs/reference/TOOLCHAIN.md`: Sony's 2.9-ee for the `ee29` objects).
   Unlike OpenRAC, which builds libgcc from GCC's own sources, nothing here
   comes from GCC's sources: the runtime's functions (the double-precision
   float support among them) are decompiled from retail like the rest
   (LEGAL.md).

   **The C++ runtime in src/lib/001FC000.cpp was built with exceptions on**
   (measured on 2026-11-02), 2.9-ee-991111's default. Its throw and
   exception-specification functions (func_001FEC10, func_001FEE48, and
   func_001FEDC8, which splat joins to func_001FEC10) match only so, and so
   does func_001FD920: with exceptions on the compiler makes no tail calls,
   and a call to a function that never returns keeps retail's frame and
   `jal`. All 53 functions matched in that file stay EXACT without
   `-fno-exceptions`. But the object then carries exception tables in
   `.data` (1,668 bytes), which the build cannot link from C yet, so the
   file keeps `-fno-exceptions` until data comes from C (docs/ROADMAP.md,
   item 2). The throw functions also need the runtime's helpers named for
   the compiler (`__eh_alloc` 0x1FE9D0, `__cp_push_exception` 0x1FEA88,
   `__throw` 0x1FE4C8, `__start_cp_handler` 0x1FE998, `__uncatch_exception`
   0x1FEBE0, `__cp_pop_exception` 0x1FEB18, `terminate__Fv` 0x1FE8F0) and
   their classes' vtables and destructors placed at retail's addresses.
   The attempts are kept under build/swarm/g63b/ and g63e/.

   **The math library is another build** (measured on 2026-11-01). Its range,
   0x204F68-0x208F90 (26 functions unmatched), puts two `nop`s before every
   `div.s` that uses a value computed just before, and sets up its frame
   before the body. None of the toolchain's compilers (2.95.3, 2.96-ee-001003-1,
   2.95.2, 2.9-ee-991111) with any of its assemblers (`ee/bin/as.exe`,
   `bin/ee-as.exe`, `ee/bin/ps2eeas.exe`) gives that, whatever the scheduling
   flags. Sony's own build `2.9-ee-991111-01` does: its compiler writes
   `nop; nop; div.s` itself. It comes in the archive OpenRAC uses for its
   DTL-S13010 assembler (decompme/compilers `ee-gcc2.9-991111-01-dtls13010.tar.gz`,
   SHA-256 `3ab52a7ea962100f2a7df3e04d3e7a758aad669eb365251682e769b755d9d586`;
   kept in the toolchain folder, never committed), as 32-bit Linux programs
   with their own loader: on macOS they run in a Linux container. Built with
   it, a near miss of func_00206298 (written for 2.9-ee-991111) comes out at
   1,064 bytes against retail's 1,072, with 89% of its instructions in line,
   against 1,016 bytes with 2.9-ee-991111; `-O2` is the right level
   (`-O1` or no scheduling is far worse).

   **The math library builds with it** (2026-11-02), as OpenRAC's
   rac1-decomp builds the objects Sony built with 2.9-ee-991111-01 (its
   `Makefile.sn` and `config/core_text.objects`). The library is
   0x204F68–0x2093F0 (PAL 0x2062A8–0x20A8B8): from the first function that
   pads `div.s` to the last one only the library calls, func_002093C0;
   func_002093F0 after it is called from game code. config/us/layout.tsv
   gives it its own folder, `src/libm/`, and config/cflags.tsv names
   `2.9-ee-991111-01` for its files. tools/compile.py runs that release's
   Linux `cc1plus` through its own loader (`lib/ld-2.3.6.so`), from
   `ee-gcc-2.9-991111-01/` or `ee-gcc-2.9-dtls13010/` in the toolchain
   directory or from `SLY1_LINUX_TOOLCHAIN`; the preprocessor and the
   assembler stay the Windows 2.9-ee-991111 ones. On x86 Linux the program
   runs as it is; elsewhere it runs in an `i386/busybox:1.36` container
   (`docker run --platform linux/386`, OrbStack or Docker Desktop on macOS),
   or under `SLY1_LINUX_RUNNER`. Without the Linux build, tools/build.py
   leaves `src/libm/` out and takes the library from the disassembly: the
   image still matches, with fewer functions from C, and it says so.
   `tools/check.py` falls back to the Windows 2.9-ee-991111 for these files,
   as rac1-decomp does, which cannot match a `div.s` function.
   `python3 tools/toolchain.py` reports which is found. The three math functions matched before this
   (func_00205318, func_00205578, func_00208FE8) are EXACT with both builds,
   in US and PAL. The first pass with it (2026-11-02) matched six more,
   func_002082F8 (2,380 bytes) among them.

   **Its bit-access macros** (2026-11-02). Two forms recur in its near
   misses:
   - a `nop` after a `b` or `jr` and its delay slot, putting the next label
     on an 8-byte boundary (0x204FB4, 0x2062EC, 0x20730C, 0x208DC4 and
     others), where this compiler aligns jump targets to 4;
   - a float argument's bits copied out (`mfc1`, `move`) and the frame set
     up before any constant is loaded, where ours loads the constants first.
   No flag or tool gives them (`-O1`, `-O3`, `-G2`, `-fno-schedule-insns`,
   `-fno-schedule-insns2`, `-fno-delayed-branch`, `-mips3`, `-mcpu=r4000` and
   `r5000`, C with the Linux `cc1`, the Linux `ee/bin/as.bin`), and
   `-malign-jumps=3` pads every jump target, not some. The compiler aligns
   the first label after the start of a loop to 8 (`-malign-loops=3`, its
   default), and a `do { } while (0)` is a loop to it: reading the float's
   bits inside one gives both forms. func_00204F68, func_00205210 and
   func_00209210 are EXACT that way and with nothing else. Retail's library
   was written with such macros, so include/float_bits.h defines a pair,
   `FLOAT_TO_BITS` and `BITS_TO_FLOAT` (our names), which src/libm uses for
   a float's bits, and the same for a double's words (`DOUBLE_TO_WORDS`,
   `WORDS_TO_DOUBLE`, `DOUBLE_HIGH`, `SET_DOUBLE_HIGH`), which func_00209010
   needs; AGENTS.md allows `do { } while (0)` there and nowhere else. With
   them all 33 functions of the library match.

Record every result here: the function, the compiler, the flags, and whether
it matched.

Additional US checks on 2026-10-29: 80 small functions across
`src/main/00104000.cpp`, `0011C000.cpp`, `00128000.cpp`, `00134000.cpp`, and
`00140000.cpp` matched with SN GCC 2.95.3 and `-O2 -G0 -fno-exceptions`.
The full US build, linked with GNU binutils using `-march=r5900 -mabi=eabi`,
printed `MATCH: build/us/SCUS_971.98 sha1
57dc305db57932ad3f1122966cdb695d2e62a47a with 1785 functions from C`.

Twenty-two near misses from this wave are retained under `nonmatching/` with
the remaining differences recorded in each file. PAL version check reported
27 absent, 42 differs, 7 error, 1709 match; 79 of the 80 functions in this
wave match at their PAL counterparts, while `func_001365A0` differs there.
Progress reported US 1785/4766 functions (13.38%) and PAL 1709/4791 (12.62%).
Unit tests printed `OK` (11 tests), and
`python3 tests/check_repository.py` printed `ok: 0 problem(s)`.
